# Razorpay Payment Gateway Implementation Report

## Overview

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Razorpay payment gateway implementation in the MailApp project. The implementation has been thoroughly reviewed and enhanced to ensure security, reliability, and proper functionality.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Components

#### 1. Core Razorpay Library (`/lib/razorpay.ts`)
- **Status**: Fully implemented with error handling
- **Features**:
  - Razorpay instance initialization
  - Order creation and management
  - Subscription creation and cancellation
  - Customer management
  - Plan creation
  - Payment signature verification
  - Helper functions for currency conversion

#### 2. API Endpoints

##### Payment Endpoints
- **`/api/payment/razorpay/create-order`**: Creates Razorpay orders with security measures
- **`/api/payment/razorpay/verify`**: Verifies payment signatures and updates subscription status

##### Subscription Endpoints
- **`/api/subscription/razorpay/create`**: Creates recurring subscriptions
- **`/api/subscription/razorpay/cancel`**: Cancels active subscriptions
- **`/api/subscription/cancel`**: Updated to support both Razorpay and Stripe

##### Webhook Endpoint
- **`/api/webhooks/razorpay`**: Handles all Razorpay webhook events
  - Payment captured/failed
  - Subscription activated/cancelled/pending
  - Includes signature verification and IP validation

#### 3. Frontend Components

##### React Components
- **`RazorpayButton`**: One-time payment component with built-in error handling
- **`RazorpaySubscription`**: Subscription management component
- **`RazorpayProvider`**: Context provider for Razorpay SDK

#### 4. Security Implementation (`/lib/razorpay-security.ts`)
- **Features**:
  - Webhook signature verification
  - Rate limiting for payment attempts
  - Input sanitization
  - Amount validation
  - Sensitive data masking for logs
  - IP whitelisting support

#### 5. Error Handling (`/lib/razorpay-errors.ts`)
- Custom error classes for better error management
- Standardized error responses
- Proper error logging with sanitized data

#### 6. Database Schema Support
The existing Prisma schema already includes:
- `razorpay_customer_id` in user_subscriptions
- `razorpay_subscription_id` in user_subscriptions
- `razorpay_order_id` in payments
- `razorpay_payment_id` in payments
- `razorpay_signature` in payments
- `payment_gateway` field supporting both "razorpay" and "stripe"

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- All payment endpoints require authenticated sessions
- User ID validation on every request
- Ownership verification for payments and subscriptions

### 2. Input Validation
- Zod schema validation for all API inputs
- Amount validation to prevent negative or excessive values
- Receipt string sanitization

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Payment attempt rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Automatic cleanup of expired rate limit entries

### 4. Webhook Security
- Signature verification using HMAC-SHA256
- Optional IP whitelisting
- Request body validation
- Idempotent webhook processing

### 5. Data Security
- Sensitive data masking in logs
- Environment variable validation
- No storage of card details (handled by Razorpay)

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
```env
# Required
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_xxxxxxxxxxxx
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Razorpay Dashboard Configuration
1. **Webhook URL**: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/razorpay`
2. **Events to Enable**:
   - payment.captured
   - payment.failed
   - subscription.activated
   - subscription.halted
   - subscription.cancelled
   - subscription.pending

## Testing

### Test Script
A comprehensive test script is available at `/scripts/test-razorpay.ts`:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-razorpay.ts
```

This script tests:
- Environment configuration
- Order creation
- Signature verification
- Helper functions

## Payment Flow

### One-time Payment Flow
1. User selects a plan and billing cycle
2. Frontend calls `/api/payment/razorpay/create-order`
3. Server creates order and returns payment details
4. Razorpay SDK opens payment modal
5. User completes payment
6. Frontend calls `/api/payment/razorpay/verify` with payment details
7. Server verifies signature and activates subscription
8. Webhook confirms payment status asynchronously

### Subscription Flow
1. User selects a subscription plan
2. Frontend calls `/api/subscription/razorpay/create`
3. Server creates customer and subscription
4. User is redirected to Razorpay hosted page
5. Webhooks handle subscription lifecycle events

## Integration with Existing System

The implementation seamlessly integrates with the existing system:
- Supports dual payment gateway setup (Razorpay + Stripe)
- Uses existing database schema without modifications
- Follows established patterns for API routes
- Maintains compatibility with existing subscription management

## Recommendations

### 1. Production Deployment
- [ ] Update environment variables with production keys
- [ ] Configure production webhook URL in Razorpay dashboard
- [ ] Enable webhook retry mechanism
- [ ] Set up monitoring for failed payments

### 2. Additional Features to Consider
- [ ] Refund API implementation
- [ ] Invoice generation
- [ ] Payment link generation for email campaigns
- [ ] Detailed payment analytics

### 3. Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Set up alerts for webhook failures
- [ ] Monitor payment success rates
- [ ] Track subscription churn
- [ ] Log all payment attempts for audit

### 4. Testing in Production
- [ ] Test with small amounts first
- [ ] Verify webhook delivery
- [ ] Test all payment methods (Card, UPI, Net Banking)
- [ ] Verify email notifications

## Conclusion

The Razorpay payment gateway has been successfully implemented with:
- ✅ Complete API integration
- ✅ Secure webhook handling
