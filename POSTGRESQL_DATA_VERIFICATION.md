| Starter Plan | starter_plan_id | starter | $29 | $299 |

### Other Data

## How to View Your Data

### Option 1: Using Prisma Studio (Recommended)
```bash
npx prisma studio
```
This will open a web interface at http://localhost:5555 where you can browse all tables and data.

### Option 2: Using Scripts
I've created several scripts to view the data:
- `npx tsx scripts/show-all-plans.ts` - Shows all plan details
- `npx tsx scripts/check-database.ts` - Verifies database connectivity
- `npx tsx scripts/check-plans.ts` - Shows plan IDs for configuration

### Option 3: Direct SQL Access
You can connect to your Neon database using any PostgreSQL client with the connection string from your `.env` file.

## Troubleshooting

If you're not seeing data in a PostgreSQL viewer:
1. Make sure you're connected to the correct database (neondb)
2. Check that you're looking in the 'public' schema
3. Refresh your connection as Neon uses connection pooling

The data is definitely there - I've verified it multiple times using different methods.
