# Gmail API Rate Limits Analysis

## Your Current Rate Limits
- **Token Grant Rate**: 100 grants per minute
- **Campaign Setting**: 80 emails per minute (per_minute_limit)
- **Actual Sending Rate**: 41.3 emails per minute (observed)

## Understanding Gmail API Limits

### 1. **Token Grant Rate (100/minute)**
This is your OAuth token refresh rate limit, NOT your email sending limit. This means:
- You can refresh your access token up to 100 times per minute
- This typically doesn't impact email sending unless tokens expire frequently
- Your app refreshes tokens only when needed (usually every ~60 minutes)

### 2. **Email Sending Limits**
Gmail API has separate limits for sending emails:
- **Daily Quota**: 1,000,000,000 quota units per day
- **Per-User Rate Limit**: 250 quota units per user per second
- **Each email send**: Uses 100 quota units

This translates to:
- **2.5 emails per second per user**
- **150 emails per minute per user**
- **~10,000 emails per day** (with other API usage)

### 3. **Your Campaign Performance**
```
Campaign: awsugkochi august meetup
Configured Rate: 80 emails/minute
Actual Rate: 41.3 emails/minute
Status: Well within limits ✓
```

## Why Your Emails Were Successfully Sent

1. **Rate Limiting Working Correctly**
   - Your app respects the 80 emails/minute limit
   - Actual rate (41.3) is even more conservative
   - No rate limit errors encountered

2. **Token Management**
   - Your 100 grants/minute is more than sufficient
   - Tokens are reused for multiple email sends
   - Only refreshed when expired

3. **Batch Processing**
   - Batch size: 40 emails
   - Processes efficiently without hitting limits

## Rate Limit Best Practices

### 1. **Current Settings Are Good**
Your current configuration is conservative and safe:
```typescript
per_minute_limit: 80  // Well below Gmail's 150/minute limit
batch_size: 40        // Reasonable batch size
```

### 2. **Optimization Opportunities**
If you need faster sending:
```typescript
// Could safely increase to:
per_minute_limit: 120  // Still below Gmail's limit
batch_size: 60         // Larger batches
```

### 3. **Monitoring Rate Limits**
The app already implements:
- Token bucket rate limiting
- Exponential backoff for retries
- Proper error handling for 429 errors

## Rate Limits Are NOT Your Delivery Issue

Your emails not reaching recipients is **NOT** due to rate limits because:
1. ✅ All 122 emails were sent successfully
2. ✅ No rate limit errors occurred
3. ✅ Sending rate was conservative (41.3/minute)
4. ✅ Gmail API accepted all emails

The delivery issues are due to:
- Spam filtering (most likely)
- Email authentication
- Sender reputation
- Not rate limits

## Recommendations

### 1. **Keep Current Rate Limits**
Your current settings are optimal:
- Safe margin below Gmail limits
- Prevents account issues
- Reliable delivery to Gmail servers

### 2. **Focus on Delivery, Not Speed**
Instead of increasing rate limits, focus on:
- Email authentication (SPF, DKIM)
- Sender reputation
- Content quality
- List hygiene

### 3. **Scale Horizontally If Needed**
For higher volume:
- Use multiple Google accounts
- Rotate sending accounts
- Or switch to professional ESP

## Summary
Your token grant rate limit of 100/minute and email sending rate of 80/minute are both well-configured and NOT causing delivery issues. The emails were successfully sent to Gmail's servers. The issue is what happens AFTER Gmail accepts them - spam filtering and inbox placement.
