# Neon PostgreSQL Connection Fix

## Issue
The application was experiencing "Error { kind: Closed, cause: None }" errors when connecting to Neon PostgreSQL database.

## Root Causes
1. **Multiple PrismaClient instances**: Each API route was creating its own PrismaClient instance instead of using a shared singleton
2. **Incorrect connection management**: Routes were calling `prisma.$disconnect()` which closed connections prematurely
3. **Missing connection pooling configuration**: Not using Neon's pooled connection endpoint

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Database Connection Library (`lib/db.ts`)
- Implemented proper singleton pattern for PrismaClient
- Added connection pooling configuration
- Added cleanup handlers for development hot reload

### 2. Updated Prisma Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Added `directUrl` configuration for migrations (non-pooled connection)
- Kept `url` for application queries (pooled connection)

### 3. Fixed API Routes
Updated the following routes to use the shared Prisma instance:
- `/app/api/payment/razorpay/create-order/route.ts`
- `/app/api/payment/razorpay/verify/route.ts`
- `/app/api/webhooks/razorpay/route.ts`
- `/app/api/subscription/cancel/route.ts`

Removed `prisma.$disconnect()` calls from all routes.

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```env
# Pooled connection for application queries (with -pooler suffix)
POSTGRES_URL=postgres://neondb_owner:npg_RQXGu2Exp5LP@ep-plain-waterfall-ad8t4p65-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&connect_timeout=10

# Direct connection for Prisma migrations (without -pooler suffix)
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=postgres://neondb_owner:npg_RQXGu2Exp5LP@ep-plain-waterfall-ad8t4p65.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

### Important Notes

1. **Connection String Requirements**:
   - Always include `sslmode=require` for secure connections
   - Use `-pooler` suffix in hostname for application queries
   - Use direct connection (no `-pooler`) for migrations
   - Add `connect_timeout=10` to handle Neon's serverless compute activation

2. **Neon Serverless Behavior**:
   - Compute instances scale to zero after 5 minutes of inactivity
   - First connection after idle period may take 1-2 seconds
   - Connection pooling helps manage this efficiently

3. **Connection Limits**:
   - Pooled connections support up to 10,000 concurrent connections
   - Direct connections have lower limits based on compute size

## Testing the Fix

1. Ensure both environment variables are set correctly
2. Run Prisma migrations with the direct URL:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```
3. Restart your application
4. Monitor logs for connection errors

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Error Monitoring**: Add proper error tracking (e.g., Sentry) to monitor connection issues
2. **Health Checks**: Implement database health check endpoints
3. **Connection Retry**: Consider adding exponential backoff for transient connection failures
4. **Query Optimization**: Use Prisma's query batching and connection pooling features
