# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Exposed Razorpay Credentials

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: The following Razorpay credentials have been exposed in the repository's history:

### Compromised Credentials:
- **API Key ID**: `rzp_live_R6jcf0rQXIBf7s`
- **API Key Secret**: `NmfRxM4znJF1WVONLZ1epZjb`
- **Webhook Secret**: `FXJ!T7cPN2gR-x6`

### Exposed Plan IDs:
- Starter Monthly: `plan_R756ULe2ADKrAK`
- Starter Yearly: `plan_R75C5I1wMcFKWJ`
- Professional Monthly: `plan_R75ENZQF1ZP3fk`
- Professional Yearly: `plan_R75Euuno76irUT`
- Enterprise Monthly: `plan_R75FKqSLzCEm5D`
- Enterprise Yearly: `plan_R75FVzznhMhvVA`

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

1. **Regenerate Razorpay API Keys Immediately**
   - Log into your Razorpay Dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
   - Regenerate both Key ID and Key Secret
   - Update the webhook secret

2. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Update your production environment variables with the new credentials
   - Update any staging/development environments
   - Ensure `.env` file is NEVER committed to Git

3. **Review Razorpay Activity**
   - Check your Razorpay dashboard for any unauthorized transactions
   - Review webhook logs for suspicious activity
   - Monitor your account for the next few days

4. **Git History Cleanup** (Optional but Recommended)
   - Consider using BFG Repo-Cleaner or git filter-branch to remove the exposed credentials from Git history
   - Force push the cleaned history (coordinate with your team)
   - All team members will need to re-clone the repository

## Prevention Best Practices:

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - Always ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`
2. **Use `.env.example`** - Commit only example files with placeholder values
3. **Use environment-specific secrets** - Different credentials for dev/staging/production
4. **Regular credential rotation** - Change API keys periodically
5. **Use secret management tools** - Consider using tools like:
   - Vercel Environment Variables
   - AWS Secrets Manager
   - HashiCorp Vault
   - GitHub Secrets (for CI/CD)

## Configuration Update:

After regenerating your credentials, update them in your deployment platform (e.g., Vercel):

```bash
# Example for Vercel
vercel env add RAZORPAY_KEY_ID
vercel env add RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET
vercel env add RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
# ... add other plan IDs
```

## Remember:
- These exposed credentials can be used by anyone who finds them
- Even if the repository is private now, the credentials are compromised
- Act immediately to prevent potential financial loss
